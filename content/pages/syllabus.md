Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course is a seminar on the nature of love and sex, approached as topics both in philosophy and in literature. Readings from recent philosophy as well as classic myths of love that occur in works of literature and lend themselves to philosophical analysis.

No quizzes or exams, but students are required to attend every class, (whether or not there are conflicting exams or study groups in other courses), arrive on time, and do the assigned reading for each weekly session. Attendance, lateness, and class discussion will be a consideration in the final grade. Two papers are required, one due onÂ lecture 9 will be at least 1500 words long (as indicated by the computer word-count on the first page) and consisting of an analysis of the material in the required reading for any week (or weeks) that the student chooses. This paper will also reveal some additional outside research that is pertinent to the philosophical problems being analyzed in the paper. The second paper will be due on the final lecture and will deal in a more extensive and original way with the issues we have been discussing. It will reveal a development in the student's thinking about relevant problems of philosophy. This paper will be at least 2000 words long (as indicated by the computer word-count on the first page). Its topic will be discussed in advance with the instructor and approved by him. Both papers are to be double-spaced (28 pts) and with a font of 14 pts.

There is no quantitative grading policy for this course. Attendance and class performance are a consideration in the final grade, and the two papers are required. The second paper, being longer and coming at the end of the term, is given greater importance. The two papers are graded in the usual way: A, B, C, etc.
